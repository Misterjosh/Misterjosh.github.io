I mamanged to do this thanks to a series of YouTube videos by James Q. Quick. I wasn't able to get there on my own. Something is clearly not clicking for me with JavaScript at this point.

I followed the videos along until he got into moving the questions into a JSON file. At that I was lost. I decided to keep them in an array in my JavaScript file.

I tried getting the timer to work, but kept constantly breaking the question display.

I believe in honesty. So, I thought I would make that known.

I worked on my own code until Friday evening. At that point I got the prebuilt code Brooks put together. I tried to get an idea of what to fix in my code. It didn't help me. No fault to him, it's my issue.

Sunday I gave up on my original and started this.
 
I also came to the understanding that there is a chance that becoming a full stack developer is beyond where I am now and possibly what I am capable of.

There was a point that I cried over my level of frustration.

This doesn't upset me anymore. I have really put in the time, read, reviewed, watched videos, and googled like crazy. I have put in over 35 hours on this homework alone.

I'm just not getting, or completely missing something(s).

Don't read this as me giving up. I still plan to learn and try. I'm just not on the level of 'make my own quiz game' currently. Hopefully this pandemic gets resolved. I need to start working with a tutor.

P.S. As of March 20th I am making decent progress with the starter code written by brooks. Hopefully I can salvage this train wreck and submit something functional. It is looking like 1/3 of the original plethora of files. I'm optimistic.
